Short biography and curriculum vitae  
  
I am currently a professor of physics and applied math at Universidad 
Industrial de Santander, in Bucaramanga, Colombia (2017-present),
and my main research interest is extragalactic astronomy. I
pursued my PhD in Science with emphasis in astronomy from the University 
of Sao Paulo in 2016, working with computer simulations of galaxies. 
I enjoy moving in the intersection between astronomy, math, and data 
science, and I have spent 
time at different institutions in Chile, Germany and France through 
fully-funded research internships (2011-2017). In the past I acted as 
the leader of the Colombian team in several international Math Olympiads 
(2006-2016). Science education and outreach is my other passion.
